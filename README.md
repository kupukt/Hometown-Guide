# Overview

This was a fun project to work on but I really don't see myself working with maps in the near future. I wanted to learn a little bit about GIS Mapping. It was cool to learn just how information worked with the map and all the different things that go along with that. I didn't realize that it was layers upon layers of information on a base map that gives us what we know best, which is something like google maps.

# Development Environment

I wrote this project using mostly JavaScript for an HTML website with CSS.
I had to learn how to actually make a map and add layers to the map and that is what I did. I started off with the basemap, then a point on the map, then a popup, then the information in a pop up. It was a lot of repetitive coding because I needed unique objects for each point on the map. I think I could have used a loop to add the points on the map but I will be working on that soon.

# Future Work

* I want to see if I can make the loops by running the different points into a loop instead of hard coding each one.
* I want to add realtime data just to check certain things like the weather when I am not in Hawaii.
